<h1 align="center">Pets Vs Orcs Hack Tools ⚙</h1>

Pets Vs Orcs - the second game from **Supercell**. Unfortunately, the game closed less than a month later due to failure. But with the help of this repository you can play it, even with the hacked version, and also see all the assets of this game.

# Installing
In the repository you can see the dll file. Keep it to yourself, you will need it.
First, download the stable version of the game from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tc274ZfXHnVLvcxDX-1StXO54i6ZoBwD/view?usp=sharing)
**Note**: Many devices do not support this game. Therefore, I recommend using either **an old device or an emulator**. To run this game, I use ***BlueStacks 4.260.0.1032*** and everything works great.

# Hacking the game
We need Apk Editor Pro. We select Pets Vs Orcs and go along the path *assets / bin / data / managed* and replace the original Assembly-CSharp.dll with the one you downloaded from the repository. Then we press the build button, wait and go in. Enjoy!

# Game Assets
I don't know if this will be useful, but I have uploaded all the game assets (images, music, animations, etc.) to this repository.
